In an attempt to penetrate the nazi    underground the U.S. army placed you in command of the 'Dirty Dozen' strike     force.                                   During your covert penetration of the  Rhineland the remaining eleven members  of operation Goldmain were wounded or   killed.                                                                          Whether their deaths were in vain is   up to you..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Before your commanding sergeant's      capture you were able to interpret the  code he gave his life to protect. Thanksto the Polish underground spy network   you have discovered and deciphered a    message concerning the precise location of fortress Lowenbrau.  This fortress   was your mission objective.                                                      With your force gone it is up to you   Colonel Stone to penetrate the fortress and destroy the plans for operation     Trove.  The plans are locked away       securely in a footlocker at the base of the foothold's flag.  Find it and       obliterate it.                                                                   Good luck.                                                                      You are the Allies only hope..        ~
