There is something dreadfully wrong   on station CTC1200. After a crack squad landing on the surface of the planet,   the party members were mysteriously     killed off one by one. Before any       explanation could be made, the dropship pilot was killed in midflight resulting in the destruction of alpha carrier.                                            You are the sole survivor.                                                      You have only caught glimpses of them.                                          You have heard rumors.                                                          The war is not over.                                                            Your only hope is to reach a signaling  device to manually land beta carrier.   You only have one chance. If these      creatures truly exist, command central  must be notifies at all costs.                                                    There is such a device somewhere in   station CTC1200. Somewhere.                                                     Watch your step.                        You never know what might attack you.
